# Machine-Learning
The goal of this task is to make yourself familiar with some continuous distributions and
plotting pdfs and histograms. First, add the following import statements:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import beta, expon, gamma, laplace, norm
For each of the following distributions, plot its density function in the given interval and
a histogram based on 1000 samples. Use .pdf(x, *args) to compute the probability
densities for the given array of x values, e.g., norm.pdf(x, a, b). Use .rvs(*args,
n) to sample n values, e.g., norm.rvs(a, b, n).
